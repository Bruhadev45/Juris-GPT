    "description": "The case arose from the rampant misuse of Section 498A IPC (cruelty by husband or his relatives), where arrests were being made mechanically without proper investigation. The Supreme Court laid down mandatory guidelines requiring police officers to satisfy themselves about the necessity of arrest based on specific parameters under Section 41 CrPC. Magistrates were directed not to authorize detention casually. Non-compliance was made a ground for departmental action against the police officer and contempt of court proceedings.",
